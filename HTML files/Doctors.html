            <h3>ENT Specialist Dr. Sanjay Bhol</h3>
            <p>An ear, nose, and throat doctor (ENT) specializes in everything having to do with those parts of the body. They even perform operations. They're also called otolaryngologists.

                Some historians think ear doctors are the oldest medical specialties in the U.S. It started in the 1800s when doctors realized that a person's ears, nose, and throat had delicately connected systems that required special knowledge.

            <h3>Cardiology Specialist Dr. Paredesiss Mahantis</h3>
            <p>A cardiologist is a doctor who’s an expert in heart and blood vessel diseases. They can treat heart diseases and help keep you from getting them.

                After completing four years of medical school, cardiologists spend three years learning general internal medicine as residents. Then, they get at least three more years of cardiology training after that.
                
                Upon graduating cardiology training, cardiologists take board exams to obtain certification from a national governing group. They then maintain their certification through periodic testing.
                
                Cardiologists must keep up with the latest advances in how to treat people to provide the best care. At the same time, they need to be experts at listening to how you describe your symptoms and finding the right solution for your issue.</p>

            <h3>Dr. Futulanthen fastis</h3>
            <p>LA dermatologist is a medical doctor who specializes in conditions that affect the skin, hair, and nails. Whether it’s rashes, wrinkles, psoriasis, or melanoma, no one understands your skin, hair, and nails better than a board-certified dermatologist.
                To become board certified in dermatology requires:

Going to medical school and becoming a doctor

Successfully completing residency training in dermatology

Passing the board exam, a challenging exam that tests the dermatologist on the knowledge and skills acquired during their years of training

Passing the board exam means the dermatologist is board certified. Board certification comes from one of these three organizations:

American Board of Dermatology

American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology

Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada

When you see that your dermatologist is board certified by one of these organizations, you know you are receiving care from someone who has received the most rigorous education in the field. There are many different kinds of boards, and other certifications do not reflect the same level of training and expertise.
